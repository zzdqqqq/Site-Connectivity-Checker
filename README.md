# Site Connectivity Checker (command line tool)
## Motivation
When you visit a URL, you expect to get the requested pages on your browser. But this is not always the case. Sometimes, sites can be down, so you wonâ€™t get the desired results. You can keep trying until it comes up.

This project build a command line tool to automatically do this work.

## TODO
- [ ] Conenct to a website by TCP protocol (Compared to ICMP TCP can get more information)
- [ ] According to the status codes, return true or false (or some other status)
- [ ] Run this command in background using "systemd". When the site response, send a alert.
